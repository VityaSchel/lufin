Lufin (Let’s Upload that File—Next) is a modern alternative to lufi with nicer design, S3 storage support (with Cloudflare R2 compatability) and rich client-side preview features, translated to 24 languages: English, Русский, Български, Čeština, Dansk, Nederlands, Eesti, Suomi, Français, Deutsch, Ελληνικά, Magyar, Italiano, Latviešu, Lietuvių, Norsk, Polski, Português, Română, Slovenčina, Slovenščina, Español, Svenska, Türkçe.

**This app requires JavaScript in order for client-side encryption to work.**

## Demo

Please keep in mind that this is a demo website — the filesize limit is very low and files are deleted after 5 minutes.

## Motivation

I was working on this project in August 2023 - October 2023 as a part of a larger platform for one of my clients. In late 2024 I had to leave working on them because the client was constantly harassing and threatening me. This is a cleaned up version of filesharing subproject that I made for them, originally built as a microfrontend for Next.js.

I made this project while I was working with React and Next.js as my primary web frameworks and MongoDB as my favorite database. Things have changed and now I strongly prefer Svelte over React and rarely use Mongo instead of PostgreSQL. All commits are deliberetly offset by exactly -22 months so that they don’t appear in my recent contributions and because I’d like to emphasize: **this is legacy, very old, stinky code**. While how the code **was written** is, in my opinion, bad, how it **works** is good and I encourage you to try the demo website to see it for yourself!
